(From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Buppharam,_Chiang_Mai))

Wat Buppharam (Thai: วัดบุพพาราม, pronounced [wát bùp.pʰāː.rāːm]) is a Buddhist temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Founded in 1497 by King Mueang Kaeo,[1] the temple was where Kawila began a ritual circumambulation of Chiang Mai to reoccupy it after two centuries of Burmese rule.[2] Most of the temple buildings date to the late 1800s.[2] The temple is also known for its Burmese-style chedi, which was rebuilt in 1958, and a Lanna-style ordination hall made from teak and glass inlay mosaic, built in 1819.[3]
